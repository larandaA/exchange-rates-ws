## API description

The WEB-service uses REST architecture style. Some of the reasons why this architecture style is appropriate are the following:

* WEB-service has a client-server architecture.
* No client state is transferred during the client-server communication.
* The messages are actually resources representations.
* The server responses to GET requests can be cached.
* All of the resources have their identifiers that are used as URI.
* Hypermedia and specific content types will help to keep API flexible.
